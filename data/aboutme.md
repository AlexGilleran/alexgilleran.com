I'm Alex Gilleran and this is my little corner of the information superhighway. I'm a developer in a number of technologies including:

*  Web (Javascript, HTML5, CSS3)
*  Node.js
*  Java
*  Android

When I'm not writing code, I enjoy motorcycling, playing games and coming up with short, awkward bios of myself.

I've built this site mainly because I'd already bought the [alexgilleran.com](http://alexgilleran.com) domain and didn't want a google of my name to lead to a parked page... however, this is also a portfolio of all my various projects and will host a blog, when/if I get around to coding the back-end for one. I thought it was pretty cool when I made it back in 2012 but it's starting to look a bit long in the tooth now...
