I'm Alex Gilleran and this is my little corner of the information superhighway. I'm a developer in a number of technologies including:

*  Java (Spring, Hibernate, Struts2, GWT)
*  Android
*  HTML5/CSS3
*  JavaScript (particularly jQuery, Angular, node.js)

When I'm not writing code, I enjoy motorcycling, playing games and coming up with short, awkward bios of myself.

I've built this site mainly because I'd already bought the [alexgilleran.com](http://alexgilleran.com) domain and didn't want a google of my name to lead to a parked page... however, this is also a portfolio of all my various projects and will host a blog, once I've got around to coding the back-end for one.
