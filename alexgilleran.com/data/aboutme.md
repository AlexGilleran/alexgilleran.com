I'm Alex Gilleran and this is my little off-ramp of the information superhighway. I'm a developer in a number of technologies including:

*  Java
*  Android
*  JavaScript (particularly jQuery, Dojo, Backbone)
*  Ruby on Rails (which I'm currently learning)

When I'm not writing code, I enjoy motorcycling, playing games and coming up with short, awkward bios of myself.

I've built this site mainly because I'd already bought the [alexgilleran.com](http://alexgilleran.com) domain and got tired of anyone who googled my name coming up with a parked page... however, I'm this also acts as a portfolio of all my various projects and host a blog, once I've got around to coding the back-end for one.
