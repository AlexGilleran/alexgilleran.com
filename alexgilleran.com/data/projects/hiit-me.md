In 2013 I was trying to do some interval training when I realised that there was no decent Android app that would simply sit in the background, read out when to stop and to go and pause my music when it did so. As I was applying for jobs at the time I thought developing a quick app to do this would be a good portfolio piece for my Android skills... I expected to have it done in about a month.

Unfortunately I didn't reckon with personal scope creep - my vision grew until it encompassed an app that would be able to read out any possible interval training programme, no matter how deeply nested the repetitions were, that would not just notify the user when to go or rest but also read out the name of the exercise they should be doing, and that would do it all in a beautiful, user friendly way. I found myself often frustrated by Android's design, as ideas that would be easy on the web took ages to reliably implement in Android.

Eventually, after nearly two years of on-and-off development, I made the final push to finish the app and released it on the store. Unfortunately by the time I'd done so there were dozens of apps that did the exact same thing, although not as well. So it hasn't set the world on fire, but I'm still proud of it.
