From the first moment I started using React I loved working with it, but I did end up feeling that the way that markup was defined in JSX was unnecessarily clunky - it was missing proper conditional and looping statements, and so I set about putting these back in.

Unfortunately the simple method of creating a component was out, as React parses an entire JSX hierarchy at once, the body of all components are always ended, meaning that an "if" component would be no use for protecting against accessing properties of null or undefined objects. Therefore I created a JSTransform transformer and later a Babel plugin to rewrite <If> statements as ternary javascript ifs, and <For> statements as array.map function calls, allowing for these control statements to be used seamlessly when defining a React component.
